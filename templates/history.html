        <h3 style="color: #000;">History Of Karate</h3>
        <p style="color:rgba(0,0, 0, 1);">
            The art of Karate is a system of combat developed on the island of Okinawa.
            Karate may allow you to defeat an opponent by the use of striking and kicking.
            The students practice hard physical training to develop fighting skills.This
            training requires strenuous physical and mental discipline. Karate helps with the
            development of a strong character and builds a feeling of respect toward our
            fellow man. The study of Karate, therefore, may be valuable to all people, male
            and female, young and old alike.
            The literal meaning of the two Japanese characters which make up the word
            Karate is "empty hands." This, of course, refers simply to the fact that Karate
            originated as a system of self-defense which relied on the effective use of the
            unarmed body of the practitioner. This system consisted of techniques of blocking
            or thwarting an attack and counter-attacking the opponent by punching, striking
            or kicking. The modern art of Karate has developed out of a thorough
            organization of these techniques.</p><p>
            Karate as a means of self-defense has the oldest history, going back hundreds
            of years. It is only in recent years that the techniques which have been handed
            down were scientifically studied and the principles evolved for making the most
            effective use of the various moves of the body. Training based on these principles
            and knowledge of the working of the muscles and the joints and the vital relation
            between movement and balance enable the modern student of Karate to be
            prepared, both physically and psychologically, to defend himself successfully
            against any would-be assailant.</p><p>
            As a physical art, Karate is almost without equal. Since it is highly dynamic
            and makes balanced use of a large number of body muscles, it provides excellent
            all-around exercise and develops coordination and agility.
            Many girls and women in Japan have taken up Karate because, in addition to
            its usefulness as self-defense, it is especially good for the figure. It is widely
            practiced by both children and older people as a means of keeping in top physical
            condition, and many schools are promoting it as a physical art among their
            students.</p>
            <p>
            As a sport,
            Karate has a relatively short history. Contest rules have been
            devised, however, and it is now possible to hold actual matches as in other
            competitive sports. because of the speed, the variety of techniques, and the splitsecond timing it calls for, many athletic-minded people have come to show an
            interest in competitive Karate and there is every indication that it will continue to
            grow in popularity.
            Western (non-Japanese) students may be interested to know that the Japan
            Karate Association emphasizes Karate's character-building aspects, in which
            respect for one's opponent (sportsmanship) is the cardinal principle.</p>
            <h2>Why Learn Karate?</h2><p>
            Karate is a Healthy Choice
            Many people think of karate and they visualize dazzling high kicks and
            dropping into the splits ala Jean Claude Van Damm. Not everyone will be
            physically able to perform these feats that are seen at the movies that typically
            stereotype karate and we're not going to pretend that we'll be able to make
            anybody a star. Our purpose is to make sure that you work at a level that is
            comfortable, yet challenging to yourself.
            Our workouts consist of a good mixture of cardiovascular endurance, strength
            training and flexibility exercises that are designed to benefit the whole body. Our
            instructors continue to research the best training methods known to the fitness
            world, and we're serious about it. People feel good when their healthy. It may
            seem like a redundant statement, but it's something that people need reminding
            of. With a healthy body, you have a healthy mind. Everything from waking up in
            the morning, and thinking clearly at school or in our jobs in this fast paced society
            that we live in becomes easier to deal with and more enjoyable when your body
            and mind are in tune.</p>
           <h6>Awareness and Self Defence</h6><p>
            The key to self defence does not rely on punching and kicking. As a matter of
            fact, we discourse physical action in any confrontation unless it is an absolute last
            resort. Learning to be aware of your surroundings and avoiding dangerous
            situations is the focus of awareness. Simple things that people probably already
            know are used as constant reminders so that awareness becomes a natural way of
            thinking. We don't want people to be paranoid or scared to walk around their own
            block or to go to school, but many bad situations can be avoided.</p>
            <h6>Concentration and Focus</h6><p>
            Concentration is something that for many people, has to be taught. Many
            doctors are now recommending people with A.D.D. (Attention Deficit Disorder)
            and A.D.H.D. (Attention Deficit and Hearing Disorder) learn karate because of
            the concentration skills that are developed through the training drills and the
            practice of kata - a serious of movements, much like a dance choreography with
            the use of karate techniques.</p>
            
            <h6>Balance</h6><p>
            Balance is a physical, and mental attribute that is developed as a result of
            karate training. Balance in the physical sense is acquired by performing drills that
            make you aware of what your body is doing while in motion. Balance as a mental
            characteristic is developed as you use karate as a mental stimulant. For most
            people karate will not be as natural as walking so you will have to rationalize your
            movements as you learn them. With the presence of a good physical and mental
            balance you will enhance and develop your skills.</p>
            <h6>Control</h6><p>
            Control is a result of focus, concentration, and confidence. Through the efforts
            of repetitive karate training people learn their limitations. The more aggressive
            person may want to push those limitations, which is not a bad thing, but they learn
            to deal with what they have in front of them. Emotions such as anger and fear
            may never leave a person completely but by practice, like anything else, you can
            learn to control them.</p>

            <h6>Respect, Discipline, and Humility</h6><p>
            
            Most educated people associate karate with discipline. This is because of the
            format in which the classes are taught. In karate there is a ranking system which
            lets people know where they stand. Karate doesn't have to be militaristic to the
            point it was originally intended (after all it is a martial art developed to defend
            ones' life) but these values are instilled. Generally a person who enters a karate
            class will see that people will bow to each other, call the instructor Sensei
            (teacher) and conform to the rules and guidelines set forth by the club. This makes
            a person feel rather awkward themselves if they don't conform to their
            surroundings. If there is a problem child or an adult with an overbearing demeanor
            they will be dealt with on a personal level. Most difficult people can be taught
            humility simply by being in an evironment where it is prominent.</p>

              <p style="color:rgba(0,0, 0, 1);">
            
            People need direction. Most people enter a karate club with visions of wearing
            a black belt. The realization of reaching that goal can be overwhelming without
            proper direction. As instructors we help individuals set reasonable goals so that a
            person can make these ambitions attainable. Instead of thinking about a black belt
            that may be five or more years down the road, we focus on our ranking system
            which breaks it down to a few months at a time. At each level the student knows
            in advance what is expected of them to reach the next level. People that learn the
            importance of mile marking goals can more readily accept some of lifes
            challenges and learn to make realistic goals for themselves when there isn't
            someone there to do it for them.</p>

                <h6>Self Confidence</h6><p>
                  You have to feel good about yourself and you have to trust in your abilities to
                  be confident. Karate teaches you how to handle pressure by applying a little bit
                  at a time. Every individual has certain a limit and once you find it you feel
                  comfortable. Once your comfortable you can start to expand or push those limits
                  and feel good about trying something you never imagined you could before.
                  Karate is an endless learning experience that provides constant challenge keeping
                  you alert and to let your confidence grow.</p>

                  <h6>Role Models</h6>
            <p>
            Like a school teacher, we as karate instructors have a responsibility to our
            students to instill positive values. Children benefit by the mental stimulation of
            learning the choreographed moves of the kata and the discipline of conforming
            to the rules of the club. An adult doesn't have to feel self conscious about getting
            the physical benefits of the exercise provided. Karate instills the confidence to
            walk away from confrontation, not to contest it head on. To teach these values at
            an early age will benefit a child for the rest of their life. On an adult perspective,
            it can shed a bit of light through the stresses of our daily routines. Constant
            Supervision & Guidance Karate clubs, unlike many health clubs provide constant
            instruction by experienced leaders. Most people don't have the discipline to work
            out by themselves and it's human nature to work on what we already do well
            rather than to work at what is more difficult. By having the instructors lead a class
            through a planned routine you get a good balanced workout. Karate also promotes
            group support by having students work with each other under the guidance of an
            instructor. This teaches a more experienced student to work their leadership skills
            by passing along information that they have gathered over the years. A less
            experienced student will also ask questions that will challenge the senior student.
            This is a challenge that requires the senior student to put trust in their abilities and
            in return a adds a real sense of accomplishment.</p>
            <h6>Karate as a Sport</h6><p>
            Karate as a sport has been on a steady incline since the late 1960s. It provides
            a method of testing your abilities in a controlled environment. The sparring is fast
            paced not only for the spectator, but requires precision skill and control by the
            competitor. In karate you pull your technique, scoring points by showing the
            judges what you could do in a self defence situation. The kata competition shows
            a combination of grace and power in technique through a series of choreographed
            movements that represent the competitor defending themselves in a multi attack
            environment. Both provide a sense of self accomplishment and build confidence
            by performing in front of their peers and an audience.</p>

            <h6>Karate is Fun!</h6><p>
            Not only do you benefit from learning the techniques and routines that karate
            provides, you do it with other people that share a common interest. Any extra
            curricular activity you involve yourself with should be a release from the stress
            or anxiety that is built up in our daily routines. People involved in karate can
            established friendships for life.</p>

        <h5 style="color: #000;"> Gichin Funakoshi The founder Of shotokan Karate
          Gichin Funakoshi Lineage</h5>
        <p style="color:rgba(0,0, 0, 1);">
          
         
          Gichin Funakoshi was born on November 10, 1868. At primary school, he became close friends with the son of Ankō Asato, a karate master who would soon become funakoshi’s first karate teacher.
          
          Gichin Funakoshi became good freinds with the Asato family and was soon making daily trips to go and practice karatedo with Anko Asato.
          
          Funakoshi also trained with Anko Itosu, was known for his incredible punches,</p>

          <p style="color:rgba(0,0, 0, 1);"><br>
          who also created the Ten Precepts (Tode Jukun) of Karate.
          
          Anko Itosu also played a major role in introducing karate into Okinawa’s schools. Anko Itosu also developed the 5 Heian kata from the longer kata Channan, as he believed Kusanku (Kanku dai) was to hard for beginners to learn.
          
          Itosu did a similar thing with long kata Naihanchi, breaking it down into three tekki kata we have today.
          
          Anko Itosu, Anko Asato and Gichin Funakoshi also trained under Matsumura “Bushi” Sōkon (1809-1899).
          
          Matsumura “Bushi” Sōkon (1809-1899), was chief martial arts instructor and bodyguard for the Okinawan King Shō Kō.
          
          He subsequently served in this capacity for the last two Okinawan kings, Shō Iku and Shō Tai. Matsumura travelled to China and studied Chuan Fa and other martial arts which he shared with his students on Okinawa.
          
          Matsumura “Bushi” Sōkon was a student of Kanga (Tode) Sakugawa (1733-1815).
          
          Kanga Sakugawa began his training in 1750 as a student of Takahara Pēchin (1683-1760). After six years of training, Takahara suggested that Sakugawa train under Kusanku, a Chinese master in Ch’uan Fa.
          
          Sakugawa spent six years training with Kusanku. He became so good that people gave him, as a nickname: “Tōde” Sakugawa (Sakugawa “Chinese Hand”).
          
          Takahara Pēchin was an early karate practitioner. He was known as a great martial artist and is believed to have been the first to explain the principles of the dō (“way”).
          
          These principles are:
          1) ijō, the way-compassion, humility, and love.
          2) katsu, the laws-complete understanding of all techniques and forms of karate.
          3) fo dedication-the seriousness of karate that must be understood not only in practice, but in actual combat. The collective translation is: “One’s duty to himself and his fellow man.”
          
          Takahara Pēchin studied under Chatan Yara (1668–1756). Chatan Yara is believed to be the first karateka to spread karate around the island of Okinawa.
          
          Chatan Yara studied under Kusanku (1670–1762).
          
          Kūsankū, also known as Kwang Shang Fu, was a Chinese martial artist master who is credited as having an influence on all the karate on Okinawa.
          
          Kūsankū learned the art of Ch’uan Fa in China from a Shaolin monk. It is likely that he studied martial arts in Fujian for much of his life.
          
          Kūsankū was sent to Ryukyu in 1756 as an ambassador of the Qing Dynasty. He lived in the village of Kumemura, near Naha. During his stay in Ryukyu, Kūsankū also taught Kanga Sakugawa.
          
          After Kūsankū’s death, Kanga Sakugawa created and named the Kusanku kata in honor of his teacher.
          
          Shotokan is named after Funakoshi’s pen name, Shōtō (松濤), which means “waving pines”. Kan means training hall.
          
          This name was coined by Funakoshi’s students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught.
          
          In 1922 when Gichin Funakoshi  was 54 years old, he held a demonstration of Okinawan karate-jutsu at the first Ministry of Education Sponsored Physical Education Exhibition.
          
          This demonstration was the first ever public display of karate-jutsu in Japan, it was an incredible success.
          
          In 1936, Funakoshi built the first Shōtōkan dojo in Tokyo. At about this time he also changed the written characters of karate to mean “empty shotokan dojohand” (空手) instead of “China hand” (唐手) (literally Tang dynasty) to downplay its connection to Chinese boxing.
          
          Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.
          
          Gichin Funakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, Karate-Do: My Way of Life.
          
          However many karateka believe his most importnt work was a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the niju kun, or “twenty principles”.
          
          These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners. Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to “become better human beings”</p>

            <h3 style="color:#000;">The JSA  and Dan Rank Certification System</h3><p>
            Japan Shotokan Association :: Dan RankingThere are 10 Kyu and 10 Dan in JSA karate. To obtain certification for each rank, you must fulfill the certification requirements and complete the testing procedure. Testing – or grading – is carried out by a panel of instructors authorized as JSA technical examiners.
            </p><p>
            Typically, Dan grading sessions take place 4 times per year, and Kyu grading takes place twice. In order to be eligible for testing, you must first have gained the appropriate amount of continuous experience at your current rank. Then, depending on the level of Dan you are being graded for, you may have to take the test outside your own country or region (at the higher Dan ranks, only  JSA HQ is authorized to evaluate, grade and issue certification).
            These details are summarized in the following chart.
            </p>
